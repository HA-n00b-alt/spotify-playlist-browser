# Spotify Playlist Tools

A modern, minimalist interface for browsing Spotify playlists with BPM/key insights and song credits.

## What You Can Do
- Browse and search all of your playlists.
- Filter and sort tracks by tempo, year, popularity, and more.
- See BPM and musical key for each track (with detailed sources).
- Open tracks, artists, and playlists directly in Spotify.
- Pull MusicBrainz credits (producer, writer, mixer, mastering).

## How It Works
1. Sign in with Spotify.
2. Choose a playlist from the list view.
3. Explore tracks, apply filters, and view BPM/key details.
4. Use the track menu to open Spotify or see credits.
